# DESCRIPTION

The File Integrity Checker is a Python-based security utility designed to monitor and detect changes in files within a specified directory.
It helps identify whether files have been modified, newly added, or left unchanged by comparing cryptographic hash values.

This tool uses the SHA-256 hashing algorithm, which generates a unique fingerprint for each file. Even a single-byte change in a file will produce a completely different hash, making this method reliable for integrity verification.
